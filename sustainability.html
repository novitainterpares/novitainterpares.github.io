					<h1>SUSTAINABILITY</h1>
				<p>We strive to operate with sustainable business practices that consider our impact on the environment and our local community and encourage our clients and partners to do the same.</p>
				<h2>Principles</h2>
				<p>Our approach to business is guided by commitments to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Minimize environmental impacts -- waste, water, energy and air quality</li>
					<li>Give back to communities by volunteering and donating resources</li>
					<li>Ensure our supply chain has responsible social and environmental practices</li>
					<li>Create innovative approaches to minimize negative environmental impacts, improve economic bottom lines and integrate social elements in our consulting work and practices</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Practical Steps and Supporting Activities</h2>
				<h3>Organizational Policies and Orientation</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure all staff are fully aware of our Sustainability Policy and are committed to implementing and improving it</li>
					<li>Comply with and exceed all municipal, provincial and federal legislation, regulations and codes of practice where feasible</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Meetings &amp; Travel</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Walk, cycle, or ride-share to meetings, site visits etc, apart from in circumstances where the alternatives are not feasible</li>
					<li>Avoid or reduce physically traveling to meetings, by suggesting video-conferencing or tele-conferencing, when possible</li>
					<li>Make efficient use of meeting times to avoid multiple trips</li>
					<li>Support the Nova Scotian economy by working with and supporting local businesses, suppliers, clients and associates whenever possible</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Consumption of Resources</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Minimize our use of paper and other office consumables by avoiding unnecessary use of materials.  For example: double sided printing, recycled paper for memos, efficient margins and refillable pens and pencils</li>
					<li>Issue documents electronically wherever possible</li>
					<li>Arrange for the reuse, recycling and composting of office waste, including paper, computer and printer supplies and paper towel in all our facilities including offices and meeting spaces</li>
					<li>Reduce energy consumption whenever possible by turning off electronics and lights when not in use. Use energy efficient lights. </li>
					<li>Monitor building's temperature with programmable thermostats. Reduce heat in stairwells, hallways</li>
					<li>Currently exploring &lsquo;smart metering&rsquo; to monitor the energy use of our office (as part of Lunenburg Smart Community Project)</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Reporting &amp; Monitoring</h2>
